## Install

1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed
2. Go to this directory
3. Run `npm install` once to fetch dependencies

## Running the code

1. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
2. Follow the instructions on screen, which usually tell you to visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) in you browser

## Running the tests

### End to end

First, make sure the development server is running - see [Running the code](#running-the-code) above.

Then, either:

* Run `npm test` to run all tests.
* Run `npm run test:manual` to open Cypress. Handy when debugging tests.
